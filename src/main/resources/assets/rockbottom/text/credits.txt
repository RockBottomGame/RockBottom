  All of the great people that
  beta test and report bugs

  ConcernedApe and his amazing work on
  Stardew Valley for inspiring me to
  create a game myself. Finding the
  Star Flower means finding the reason
  that Rock Bottom exists.





&iRock Bottom was inspired by amazing
&igames like Minecraft, Terraria and
&iStardew Valley.
&iI believe that video games are an
&iawesome way of bringing people together
&ito create something amazing.
&iRock Bottom wasn't created with the
&iintent to be "just another sandbox game",
&ibut to create a great community of
&iplayers, modders and content creators
&ithat have fun with what they do.
&iI hope that you enjoy playing the game
&ias much as we enjoy working on it.
